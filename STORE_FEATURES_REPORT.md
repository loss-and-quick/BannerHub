## GOG

### GOG-1: Cloud Saves
**Status:** ⬜ Not started — after GOG-3  
**Description:** Upload and download save files between the Wine prefix and GOG's cloud save service per game.  
**API:** GOG Galaxy cloud saves API (`api.gog.com/userData/{userId}/games/{gameId}/saves`)  
**Notes:**
- Need to identify save file locations per game (from Wine prefix or user-specified path)
- Upload: POST file → GOG cloud
- Download/restore: fetch → write to Wine prefix path
- Show last synced timestamp per game in library

**Progress Log:**
- 2026-04-14: `GogGameDetailActivity` scaffolding complete (v3.0.1-pre). CLOUD SAVES section exists as stub at line 145–146. Replace with upload/download UI once GOG-2 and GOG-3 are done.

---

### GOG-2: Game Update Checker
**Status:** ✅ v3.0.1-pre — confirmed working  
**Description:** Compare installed build ID against latest available on content-system. Show "Update available" badge and allow download.  
**API:** `content-system.gog.com/products/{gameId}/os/windows/builds`  
**Notes:**
- Installed build ID is stored at download time — need to persist it to SP
- Fetch latest build from content-system, compare
- If newer: show badge on game card + "Update" button in detail dialog
- Update = re-run existing download pipeline with latest manifest

**Progress Log:**
- 2026-04-14: `GogGameDetailActivity` scaffolding complete (v3.0.1-pre, commit `53a38f663`). UPDATES section exists as stub at line 137–138 (`makeStubCard("Update checker coming soon")`). Replace stub with real implementation: fetch builds endpoint, compare build ID stored in `bh_gog_prefs` as `gog_build_{gameId}`, show "Up to date" or "Update available" + Update button.

---

### GOG-3: DLC Management
**Status:** ⬜ Not started — after GOG-2  
**Description:** List owned DLCs per game and allow separate download + install.  
**API:** GOG library endpoint already returns DLC entries — currently filtered out  
**Notes:**
- DLCs are in the same library response, identified by `dlcs` array on parent product
- Show DLC list in game detail dialog with install status
- Download uses same content-system pipeline as base game

**Progress Log:**
- 2026-04-14: `GogGameDetailActivity` scaffolding complete (v3.0.1-pre). DLC section exists as stub at line 141–142. Replace with DLC list once GOG-2 is done.

---

### GOG-4: GOG Connect
**Status:** ⬜ Not started  
**Description:** Show Steam games the user owns that are claimable for free on GOG. Claim them with one tap.  
**API:** `api.gog.com/connect` — requires Steam session ticket + GOG auth  
**Notes:**
- Requires Steam login on device (complex dependency)
- Lower priority than other GOG features
- May not be feasible without Steam integration

**Progress Log:**

## Epic Games

### EPIC-1: Free Games Section
**Status:** ⬜ Not started — separate from detail page work  
**Description:** Show current free games at top of Epic tab. Claim button adds to library using existing session.  
**API:** `store-site-backend-static-ipv4.ak.epicgames.com/freeGamesPromotions` (no auth needed for list)  
**Notes:**
- Fetch free games list on Epic tab open (or cache with TTL)
- Show as a "Free This Week" card row above the library
- Claim: POST to Epic's order endpoint using existing OAuth token
- Next free games (upcoming) can also be shown
- Lives in `EpicGamesActivity`, not the detail activity

**Progress Log:**
_(empty)_

---

### EPIC-2: Cloud Saves
**Status:** ⬜ Not started — after EPIC-3 and EPIC-4  
**Description:** Upload/download save files between Wine prefix and Epic cloud save service per game.  
**API:** Epic cloud saves via `cloudsave-public-service-prod06.ol.epicgames.com`  
**Notes:**
- Each game has a `cloudSaveFolder` defined in its manifest/catalog metadata
- Need to map Windows save path to Wine prefix equivalent
- Upload: PUT file to cloud save endpoint
- Download: GET + write to Wine prefix

**Progress Log:**
- 2026-04-14: `EpicGameDetailActivity` scaffolding complete (v3.0.1-pre, commit `53a38f663`). CLOUD SAVES stub at line 138–139. Replace once EPIC-3 and EPIC-4 are done.

---

### EPIC-3: Game Update Checker
**Status:** ✅ v3.0.1-pre — confirmed working  
**Description:** Compare installed manifest version against latest. Show update badge and allow download.  
**API:** Same manifest endpoint used during install — re-fetch and compare version field  
**Notes:**
- Store installed manifest version to SP at download time
- Re-fetch manifest on library sync and compare
- Update = re-run existing chunked download pipeline with new manifest

**Progress Log:**
- 2026-04-14: `EpicGameDetailActivity` scaffolding complete (v3.0.1-pre). UPDATES stub at line 132–133 (`makeStubCard("Update checker coming soon")`). SP key to store installed version: `epic_manifest_version_{appName}`. Re-fetch via `EpicApiClient.getManifestApiJson()`, parse version field, compare.

---

### EPIC-4: DLC / Add-on Management
**Status:** ⬜ Not started — after EPIC-3  
**Description:** List and install owned DLC separately from base game.  
**API:** Epic catalog API — DLCs are separate catalog items linked to base game  
**Notes:**
- Query catalog for items where `mainGameItem` matches the base game
- Filter to owned items only using existing entitlements check
- Download uses same chunked manifest pipeline

**Progress Log:**
- 2026-04-14: `EpicGameDetailActivity` scaffolding complete (v3.0.1-pre). DLC stub at line 135–136. Replace once EPIC-3 is done.

No CLOUD SAVES section for Amazon (not supported).

---

### AMAZON-2: DLC Management
**Status:** ⬜ Not started — after AMAZON-1  
**Description:** Surface DLC entitlements per game and allow separate download + install.  
**API:** `GetEntitlements` already returns DLC — currently filtered out by `GAME` type check  
**Notes:**
- Remove or soften the type filter to also capture DLC entitlements
- Group DLCs under their parent game in the UI
- Download uses same manifest pipeline as base game

**Progress Log:**
- 2026-04-14: `AmazonGameDetailActivity` scaffolding complete (v3.0.1-pre). DLC stub at line 135–136. Replace once AMAZON-1 is done.

**Notes:**
- Check `pc_g_setting{gameId}` SP on launch — if empty/minimal, query worker `/list?game=`
