# BannerHub

**GameHub 5.3.5 ReVanced** — extended with GOG Games, Amazon Games, and Epic Games Store library tabs, a full Component Manager, in-app component downloader, Winlator HUD overlay, in-game performance toggles, RTS touch controls, VRAM unlock, per-game CPU core affinity, root access management, offline Steam launch, Japanese locale, and more. Built entirely with apktool smali patching — no source code, no external library injection.

## AI Disclaimer

All smali edits, patches, and code changes in this project are developed with the assistance of **[Claude AI Sonnet 4.6](https://www.anthropic.com/claude)** by Anthropic. Claude is used to write, review, and modify smali bytecode and Java extension code since this project has no source code to work from — all changes are applied directly to the decompiled APK via apktool.

Before any stable release is published, all changes are manually debugged and tested by me across multiple devices — both rooted and unrooted. Debugging is done using logcat output and in-app debug log files to diagnose and verify behavior before changes are finalized.

## Installation

Download the APK that matches your existing GameHub package name from the [latest release](https://github.com/The412Banner/bannerhub/releases/latest):

| APK | Package | App Label |
|-----|---------|-----------|
| `BannerHub-vX.Y.Z-Normal.apk` | `banner.hub` | BannerHub |
| `BannerHub-vX.Y.Z-Normal.GHL.apk` | `gamehub.lite` | BannerHub |
| `BannerHub-vX.Y.Z-PuBG.apk` | `com.tencent.ig` | BannerHub PuBG |
| `BannerHub-vX.Y.Z-AnTuTu.apk` | `com.antutu.ABenchMark` | BannerHub AnTuTu |
| `BannerHub-vX.Y.Z-alt-AnTuTu.apk` | `com.antutu.benchmark.full` | BannerHub AnTuTu |
| `BannerHub-vX.Y.Z-PuBG-CrossFire.apk` | `com.tencent.tmgp.cf` | BannerHub PuBG CrossFire |
| `BannerHub-vX.Y.Z-Ludashi.apk` | `com.ludashi.aibench` | BannerHub Ludashi |
| `BannerHub-vX.Y.Z-Genshin.apk` | `com.mihoyo.genshinimpact` | BannerHub Genshin |
| `BannerHub-vX.Y.Z-Original.apk` | `com.xiaoji.egggame` | BannerHub Original |

**Which APK do I need?**

If you do not already have any GameHub variant installed, use the **Normal APK** (`banner.hub`). It installs as a completely separate app alongside the official GameHub Lite — both can coexist. If you already have the official GameHub Lite (`gamehub.lite`) installed and want BannerHub to replace it, use **Normal.GHL**. If you use a specific GameHub variant for a particular game (e.g. PuBG or Genshin), pick the matching APK so BannerHub replaces that variant's slot.

All 9 variants can be installed simultaneously. All APKs are signed with AOSP testkey (v1/v2/v3).

> **Note:** You must uninstall your existing BannerHub build before installing a new release if the signing certificate changed. Data is not preserved across uninstall.

## Features

### GOG Games

Accessible via the left side menu → **GOG**.

For the complete technical implementation breakdown, see [GOG_IMPLEMENTATION.md](GOG_IMPLEMENTATION.md) (API endpoints, auth flow, manifest format, download pipeline, BannerHub integration guide).

#### Authentication

- **OAuth2 login** — a WebView opens GOG's standard OAuth2 authorization page. After you log in, BannerHub captures the authorization code from the redirect URL and exchanges it for an access token + refresh token. Both tokens are stored in the `bh_gog_prefs` SharedPreferences file.
- **Auto token refresh** — before every API call, BannerHub checks the token expiry timestamp. If the token has expired (or will expire within the margin), it silently issues a refresh request using the stored refresh token. You never need to log in again unless you explicitly log out.
- **Login persistence** — your session survives app restarts and device reboots.

#### Library

- **Library sync** — on login or manual refresh, BannerHub fetches your full GOG library. Both Generation 1 (pre-Galaxy era) and Generation 2 (Galaxy) games are included.
- **Metadata per game** — title, developer, description, cover image, download size, Gen 1 / Gen 2 badge.
- **Game cards** — scrollable list and grid view with cover art, title, developer, install state, Install / progress / Add / Launch button.

#### Download Pipeline

BannerHub supports both GOG's current and legacy download systems:

**Generation 2 (Galaxy-era games):**

1. Fetches the build manifest from `content-system.gog.com/products/{id}/os/windows/builds`
2. Reads the depot manifest URL from the build record
3. Downloads and parses the depot manifest to get the full file list with CDN paths
4. Downloads each file individually, writing to `filesDir/gog_games/{title}/`
5. Per-file progress shown in real time — filename + percentage + download speed (MB/s)

**Generation 1 (pre-Galaxy legacy games):**

1. Fetches builds with `generation=1` parameter
2. Reads the depot manifest, parses `depot.files[]`, skips support-only files
3. Downloads each file using `Range` HTTP requests (byte-range resumable download)
4. Assembles files into the install directory

**Installer fallback (very old pre-Galaxy games with no content-system builds):**

1. Calls `api.gog.com/products/{id}?expand=downloads`
2. Reads the `downlink` or `manualUrl` from the downloads object
3. Downloads the Windows installer `.exe` directly

#### Install Flow

- Tapping **Install** opens a confirmation dialog showing download size and available storage — nothing downloads until you confirm.
- A `ProgressBar` + status text replaces the Install button during download. A red **Cancel** button appears; tapping it stops the download and cleans up partial files.
- After install, BannerHub scans for qualifying executables (excluding redist/setup/unins/crash/helper paths). One found → auto-selected. Two or more → exe picker dialog.
- On completion an **Add Game** button appears. Tapping it opens GameHub's `EditImportedGameInfoDialog` pre-populated with the executable path.
- A green ✓ **Installed** checkmark appears on the card immediately — no app restart needed.

#### Post-Install

- **Persistent install state** — `bh_gog_prefs` is read on every app open; already-installed cards show checkmark and Add button automatically.
- **Launch** — Add Game button passes the stored executable path to `EditImportedGameInfoDialog`.
- **Set .exe** — detail dialog shows current executable and a **Set .exe…** button to re-scan and re-pick at any time.
- **Copy to Downloads** — recursively copies `filesDir/gog_games/{dirName}/` to `Downloads/{dirName}/`.
- **Uninstall** — recursively deletes install directory, removes all prefs keys, resets card. Both header ✓ and expanded ✓ disappear immediately.

---

### Amazon Games

Accessible via the left side menu → **Amazon Games**.

For the complete technical implementation breakdown, see [AMAZON_IMPLEMENTATION.md](AMAZON_IMPLEMENTATION.md) (PKCE auth, GetEntitlements API, manifest.proto format, XZ/LZMA decode, FuelPump env vars, SDK DLL deployment, BannerHub integration guide).

*Pipeline based on research by [The GameNative Team](https://github.com/utkarshdalal/GameNative).*

#### Authentication

- **PKCE OAuth2 login** — a WebView opens Amazon's standard sign-in page. BannerHub intercepts the authorization code directly from the redirect URL — the detection checks for `openid.oa2.authorization_code=` in any redirect URL, so it works correctly through OTP / 2FA intermediate pages without hanging. Tokens are stored in `bh_amazon_prefs`.
- **Auto token refresh** — silently refreshed before expiry. You never need to log in again unless you uninstall.

#### Library

- **Library sync** — fetches your full Amazon Games entitlements list via `GetEntitlements`. Each entry includes title, product SKU, entitlement ID, and cover art.
- **Game cards** — scrollable list and grid view with cover art, title, install state, Install / progress / Launch button.

#### Download Pipeline

1. Calls `GetGameDownload` to retrieve the CDN download URL and version ID
2. Downloads `manifest.proto` — a protobuf manifest listing every file with its CDN hash path, size, and SHA-256 checksum
3. Downloads files in **6 parallel threads** — each file fetched via its hash path, SHA-256 verified, renamed to final path
4. Progress shows current filename and download speed (MB/s)
5. Resumable — already-complete files (matching size) are skipped on retry

#### Post-Install

- **Launch** — reads `fuel.json` from the install directory to determine the executable and required FuelPump environment variables, then launches via GameHub's `EditImportedGameInfoDialog`
- **SDK DLLs** — `FuelSDK_x64.dll` and `AmazonGamesSDK_*` DLLs are deployed to the install directory at launch time
- **Set .exe** — detail dialog lets you override the detected executable at any time
- **Update checker** — compares installed version against current CDN version; marks cards with an update badge when newer version is available
- **Uninstall** — removes install directory and all prefs; both header ✓ and expanded ✓ disappear immediately

---

### Epic Games Store

Accessible via the left side menu → **Epic Games**.

For the complete technical implementation breakdown, see [EPIC_IMPLEMENTATION.md](EPIC_IMPLEMENTATION.md) (OAuth2 auth, library API, manifest format, CDN selection, chunk download pipeline, BannerHub integration guide).

*Pipeline based on research by [The GameNative Team](https://github.com/utkarshdalal/GameNative).*

#### Authentication

- **OAuth2 login** — a WebView opens Epic's login page. After sign-in, BannerHub reads the `authorizationCode` from Epic's JSON redirect response body via `evaluateJavascript`, exchanges it for tokens using the Legendary client credentials, and stores them in `bh_epic_prefs`.
- **Auto token refresh** — silently refreshed before expiry.

#### Library

- **Library sync** — fetches owned games from Epic's library API, enriches each entry with catalog metadata: title, developer, description, cover art, DLC detection, CanRunOffline flag.
- **Game cards** — scrollable list and grid view with cover art, title, developer, and install state.

#### Download Pipeline

1. Fetches the manifest API JSON to locate manifest files on Epic's CDN
2. Downloads the binary or JSON manifest — parses full file list, chunk map, per-chunk SHA-1 hashes
3. Downloads chunks in **6 parallel threads** from Fastly or Akamai CDN (public — no auth token required on chunks)
4. Assembles each game file from its ordered chunks, SHA-1 verified per chunk
5. Progress shows current filename and download speed (MB/s)

#### Post-Install

- **Launch** — sets `pending_epic_exe` in SharedPreferences → picked up by the main launcher activity → opens `EditImportedGameInfoDialog`
- **Set .exe** — override the detected executable at any time
- **Uninstall** — removes install directory and prefs; both header ✓ and expanded ✓ disappear immediately

---

### Component Manager

Accessible via the left side menu → **Components**.

The Component Manager gives you full control over the WCP/ZIP components that GameHub uses to run Windows games — the DXVK, VKD3D, Box64, FEXCore, and GPU Driver entries that appear in per-game settings.

#### Card UI

Each installed component is displayed as a compact card with:

- **Color-coded type badge** — DXVK (blue), VKD3D (purple), Box64 (green), FEXCore (orange), GPU Driver (yellow), WCP (grey) — with a matching left accent strip
- **Source badge** — components downloaded via BannerHub show the repo they came from (e.g. "Arihany WCPHub", "Nightlies by The412Banner")
- **Install count** in the header showing total managed components
- **Live search bar** — type any part of a component name to filter cards in real time

#### Actions

| Action | How to trigger | What it does |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| **Inject file** | Tap a card, select a WCP or ZIP | Replaces the component's contents with the new file. The folder is cleared first — no stale files |
| **Add New Component** | Tap **"+ Add New"** in the bottom bar | Injects a WCP or ZIP as a brand new component slot. It immediately appears in GameHub's DXVK/VKD3D/Box64/FEXCore/GPU Driver selection menus and persists across restarts |
| **Backup** | Swipe RIGHT on a card | Copies the component folder to `Downloads/BannerHub/{name}/` |
| **Remove** | Swipe LEFT on a card | Unregisters the component from GameHub's in-memory map, deletes the folder on disk, and clears its downloaded indicator in the online repo browser |
| **Remove All** | Tap "Remove All" | Removes only BannerHub-managed components. The confirmation dialog shows the exact count. Stock GameHub components are never touched |

#### Format Support

| Format | Used by | Extraction |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| ZIP (PK magic) | Turnip, adrenotools GPU drivers | Flat extraction — `meta.json` + `.so` files land directly in the component root |
| Zstd-compressed tar (`.wcp`) | DXVK, VKD3D, Box64 | Preserves `system32/` + `syswow64/` internal structure |
| XZ-compressed tar (`.wcp`) | FEXCore nightlies | Flat extraction to component root |

BannerHub uses GameHub's own bundled libraries (`commons-compress`, `zstd-jni`, `tukaani xz`) for extraction — no external dependencies are injected, so there are no class loader conflicts.

---

### In-App Component Downloader

Inside the Component Manager, tap **Download** at the bottom of the screen to open the **Download Components** browser and install components directly from GitHub without leaving the app.

#### Navigation

Three-level navigation: **Repo** → **Category** → **Asset list**

- **Repo list** — all built-in sources shown as selectable entries
- **Category list** — choose from DXVK, VKD3D, Box64, FEXCore, or GPU Driver
- **Asset list** — shows all available assets with file size where available. Assets already installed via BannerHub show a checkmark; the mark clears when the component is removed

Tapping any asset downloads it to the cache directory and injects it as a new component automatically, with a progress screen showing "Downloading: `<filename>`" during the fetch.

#### Built-in Sources

| Source | Format | Types available |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| [**Arihany WCPHub**](https://github.com/Arihany/WinlatorWCPHub) | `pack.json` flat manifest | DXVK, VKD3D, Box64, FEXCore, GPU Drivers |
| [**The412Banner Nightlies**](https://github.com/The412Banner/Nightlies) | GitHub Releases API (`nightly-*` tag) | DXVK, VKD3D-Proton, Box64, FEXCore, GPU Drivers |
| **Kimchi GPU Drivers** | GitHub Releases API | GPU Drivers only |
| **StevenMXZ GPU Drivers** | GitHub Releases API | GPU Drivers only |
| **MTR GPU Drivers** (MaxesTechReview) | `rankings.json` | GPU Drivers only |
| **Whitebelyash GPU Drivers** | GitHub Releases API | GPU Drivers only |

---

### BCI Launcher Button

A shortcut button appears in GameHub's **top-right toolbar**. Tapping it opens [BannersComponentInjector](https://github.com/The412Banner/BannersComponentInjector) (`com.banner.inject`) directly from inside BannerHub. If BCI is not installed, a toast message is shown instead.

BCI is a companion app that provides SAF-based component management without root — useful for managing virtual containers, accessing Steam shadercache, and injecting components from your local storage.

---

### Winlator HUD Overlay

An in-game heads-up display that shows real-time performance metrics while a game is running. Accessible from the in-game **Performance sidebar**.

#### Metrics Displayed

- **FPS** — current frames per second
- **Frame time** — milliseconds per frame
- **Resolution** — current render resolution

#### Configuration

- **Opacity slider** — adjusts the transparency of the entire HUD overlay from fully opaque to nearly invisible
- **Text outline** — a black shadow/outline is automatically applied to all HUD text when opacity drops below 30%, ensuring readability against any background color
- **Position** — choose from multiple screen corners/positions
- **Orientation** — horizontal or vertical layout

All position, orientation, and opacity settings are persisted in SharedPreferences and restored automatically the next time the Performance sidebar is opened.

---

### Performance Sidebar Toggles

Located in the in-game **Performance sidebar tab**, above the Dual Battery Mode toggle. Both toggles persist their state in `bh_prefs` SharedPreferences and are re-applied automatically every time the Performance sidebar is opened.

> **WARNING — USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**
>
> These toggles override your device's thermal management. Forcing the CPU and GPU to run at maximum frequency continuously generates significantly more heat than normal operation. Sustained high temperatures can cause permanent damage to your device's processor, battery, and other components. Device manufacturers do not support or warrant against damage caused by overriding performance governors. By using these toggles you accept full responsibility for any damage, data loss, throttling, unexpected shutdowns, or reduced component lifespan that results. **Do not leave these enabled unattended. Monitor your device temperature. Disable them immediately if your device becomes uncomfortably hot.**

Both toggles require root. Without root, both are greyed out at 50% opacity and non-interactive. Root access is checked once when you grant it in **Settings → Advanced** — there is no root popup every time the sidebar opens.

#### Sustained Performance Mode

Sets all CPU cores to the `performance` frequency governor via `su`, eliminating all downclocking while the toggle is on. On disable, `schedutil` is restored.

```sh
# Enable
for f in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor; do echo performance > "$f"; done
# Disable
for f in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor; do echo schedutil > "$f"; done
```

#### Max Adreno Clocks

Locks the Qualcomm Adreno GPU clock floor equal to the ceiling via the KGSL devfreq sysfs interface, so the GPU cannot downclock under any load condition short of a kernel thermal emergency.

```sh
# Enable — set min_freq = max_freq
cat /sys/class/kgsl/kgsl-3d0/devfreq/max_freq > /sys/class/kgsl/kgsl-3d0/devfreq/min_freq
# Disable — remove floor
echo 0 > /sys/class/kgsl/kgsl-3d0/devfreq/min_freq
```

**Use both toggles together** for maximum sustained CPU + GPU performance (root required).

---

### RTS Touch Controls

*Thanks to [@Nightwalker743](https://github.com/Nightwalker743) for making this possible.*

Enable via the **Controls tab** in the in-game sidebar. Adds a full gesture overlay for PC strategy and RTS games that maps touch gestures to mouse inputs inside the Wine environment.

#### Gesture Map

| Gesture | Mouse action |
|---------|-------------|
| Single tap | Move cursor + left-click at tap position |
| Drag | Hold LMB while dragging — draws a box selection |
| Long press (300 ms) | Right-click at press position |
| Double-tap (within 250 ms / 50 px) | Double left-click |
| Two-finger pan | Camera pan (direction configurable) |
| Pinch to zoom | Mouse wheel scroll up/down (configurable) |

Tap the **gear icon** in the Controls tab to configure pan direction and pinch-to-zoom scroll direction.

---

### VRAM Limit Unlock

PC game settings → **VRAM Limit** now includes **6 GB, 8 GB, 12 GB, and 16 GB** options in addition to the original GameHub range of 512 MB through 4 GB.

---

### Per-Game CPU Core Affinity

PC game settings → **Core Count** is replaced with a multi-select dialog to choose exactly which CPU cores the game process is pinned to.

| Core(s) | Label |
|---------|-------|
| Core 0–3 | Efficiency |
| Core 4–6 | Performance |
| Core 7 | Prime |

- **Apply** — saves the selected core bitmask and updates the settings row label immediately
- **No Limit** — clears affinity, the game process can use any core
- Selecting all 8 cores is equivalent to No Limit

---

### PC Game Settings: Offline Mode

Opening PC game settings while offline no longer blocks with a spinner or error. Container and component lists fall back to empty data, and all settings rows remain fully accessible and editable without a network connection.

---

### Offline Steam Launch

When Steam auto-login fails at cold start with no network, BannerHub detects the condition, skips the Steam login screen, and proceeds using the locally cached Steam configuration. You can continue playing your installed Steam library offline.

---

### Settings: Advanced Tab

| Setting | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| **EmuReady API** | Toggle EmuReady compatibility checks |
| **CPU Usage Display** | Show/hide CPU usage overlay during gameplay |
| **Performance Metrics** | Show/hide full performance metrics overlay |
| **Sustained Performance Mode** | Same toggle as the Performance sidebar — available here for convenience outside a running game |
| **Grant Root Access** | Opens a warning dialog, then runs `su -c id` on a background thread and stores the result. Performance sidebar reads this pref to enable or grey out the root-dependent toggles — no unsolicited root popup on sidebar open |

---

### Controller Navigation

All three game store activities (GOG, Epic, Amazon) support full D-pad / gamepad controller navigation.

- **Game cards (list view)** — navigate up/down with D-pad; focused card shows a **gold 3dp border** + slightly lighter background; press A to expand/collapse
- **Game tiles (grid/poster view)** — navigate in all four directions; focused tile shows a gold border via a foreground overlay (works correctly with rounded-corner art clipping); press A to expand/select
- **Header buttons** (back ←, view toggle, refresh ↺) — focusable with a gold 2dp border + lighter fill on focus; press A to activate

Focus highlight uses gold (#FFD700) consistently across all stores and view modes.

---

### Wine Task Manager

Accessible from the **in-game sidebar** (three-bar icon) while a game is running. Provides live monitoring and control of the Wine session without leaving the game.

#### Tabs

| Tab | What it shows |
|-----|--------------|
| **Container Info** | CPU cores (WINEMU_CPU_AFFINITY), RAM (/proc/meminfo), VRam (SharedPreferences), device model, Android version |
| **Applications** | All `wine*` host processes with PID — tap any row to kill it |
| **Processes** | All `.exe` guest processes with PID — tap any row to kill it |
| **Launch** | WINEPREFIX file browser — navigate directories (yellow ▶), tap any `.exe / .msi / .bat / .cmd` file (white) to launch it via the Wine binary |

All tabs auto-refresh every 3 seconds. The **Kill** button at the top terminates the selected process immediately.

#### Launch Tab

The Launch tab lets you run additional executables inside an already-running Wine session — useful for launchers, patchers, or tools that the game itself doesn't start. The browser starts at `dosdevices/` in the WINEPREFIX and drills down from there.

A launch guard prevents Wine's "session complete" callback from tearing down the active game session when the secondary executable closes. The guard is released automatically 3 seconds after the secondary process exits.

---

### Component Descriptions in Game Settings

When selecting a component in per-game settings (DXVK, VKD3D, Box64, FEXCore, or GPU Driver picker), components installed via BannerHub show their **description text** below the component name. The description is read from `profile.json` (WCP files) or `meta.json` (ZIP / adrenotools) at inject time and stored alongside the component.

---

### Japanese Locale

BannerHub includes a complete **3,468-string Japanese translation** covering every screen in the app. When your Android system language is set to Japanese, the app displays fully in Japanese. English users are unaffected — Android's locale fallback uses the default English strings automatically.

*Translation contributed by [reindex-ot](https://github.com/reindex-ot) via Crowdin (GameHub's official translation source).*

---

### UI Tweaks

- The **"My"** tab in the bottom navigation bar is renamed to **"My Games"** for clarity.

---

## How It Works

1. The original GameHub 5.3.5 ReVanced APK (compiled and patched by [@playday3008](https://github.com/playday3008/gamehub-patches)) is stored as a permanent release asset under the `base-apk` tag in this repo (136 MB).
2. CI downloads the base APK, decompiles it with apktool, and overlays everything in the `patches/` directory — new smali classes, modified smali files, new resource files, and layout edits.
3. apktool rebuilds the APK from the merged source tree.
4. The rebuilt APK is zipaligned and signed with AOSP testkey (v1 + v2 + v3 signatures).
5. The CI matrix builds all 9 package variants in parallel and uploads them to the GitHub Release.

All new BannerHub code lives in `smali_classes16/`. Existing GameHub smali files that needed modification are patched in place. No external dex files are injected — GameHub's own bundled `commons-compress`, `zstd-jni`, and `tukaani xz` libraries are used at runtime.

`smali_classes12` is at the dex method index limit and is never reassembled — the original `classes12.dex` is extracted from the base APK and zip-injected directly after the rebuild step to bypass the limit.

---

## FAQ

**Q: Does BannerHub require root?**

Most features work without root. The only features that require root are the two Performance sidebar toggles (Sustained Performance Mode and Max Adreno Clocks) — both are greyed out and non-interactive on non-rooted devices. All other features — the GOG, Amazon, and Epic Games tabs, Component Manager, component downloader, Winlator HUD, RTS controls, VRAM unlock, core affinity, offline modes, and settings — work on any non-rooted Android device.

**Q: Will this replace my existing GameHub install?**

Only if you choose a matching package APK. The **Normal APK** (`banner.hub`) installs as a completely separate app alongside the official GameHub Lite. The **Normal.GHL APK** (`gamehub.lite`) will replace the official GameHub Lite slot — uninstall it first. All other variant APKs replace their respective GameHub variant slots.

**Q: Can I use BCI (BannersComponentInjector) with BannerHub?**

Yes. BCI grants SAF access to any GameHub package, including `banner.hub`. The BCI launcher button in BannerHub's toolbar opens BCI directly. Components injected via BCI are visible in BannerHub's Component Manager and vice versa.

**Q: Why does the Max Adreno Clocks toggle require root while some other apps can do it without root?**

BannerHub uses a direct sysfs write to `/sys/class/kgsl/kgsl-3d0/devfreq/min_freq` which is a privileged operation. Some emulators use the KGSL ioctl interface instead, which is accessible to unprivileged apps — but that interface issues a performance hint the driver can still override under thermal pressure. The sysfs approach is a harder lock, at the cost of requiring root.

**Q: My GOG game says "Generation 1" — will it still download?**

Yes. BannerHub supports Gen 1 downloads via the legacy byte-range download pipeline. If your game is so old that it has no content-system builds at all, the installer fallback will download the Windows `.exe` installer directly.

**Q: Where are GOG / Amazon / Epic games installed?**

Inside the app's private storage: `Android/data/<package>/files/gog_games/<name>/`, `amazon_games/<name>/`, or `epic_games/<name>/` respectively. GOG games have a **Copy to Downloads** button in the detail dialog to copy files to `Downloads/<name>/` for access from any file manager.

**Q: Does Amazon login work with two-factor authentication (OTP)?**

Yes. BannerHub detects the authorization code directly in the redirect URL regardless of which intermediate pages Amazon routes through during OTP/2FA, so login completes correctly with or without 2FA enabled on your account.
