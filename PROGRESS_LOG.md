## Session 1 — 2026-03-12

### [init] — Initial repo setup
**Commit:** `78c525c` | **Tag:** none
#### What changed
- Created GitHub repo `The412Banner/bannerhub`
- Built apktool-based rebuild workflow: downloads base APK → decompile → overlay `patches/` → rebuild → sign → release
- Generated debug keystore (`keystore.jks`, alias: `bannerhub`, pw: `bannerhub123`)
- Uploaded original `Gamehub-5.3.5-Revanced-Normal.apk` as `base-apk` release asset (136MB)
- `.gitignore` excludes `apktool_out/`, `jadx_out/`, `base/`, rebuilt APKs
#### Files touched
- `.github/workflows/build.yml`
- `keystore.jks`
- `patches/.gitkeep`
- `.gitignore`, `README.md`

---

### [fix] — Workflow: apktool permission denied
**Commit:** `0068e4e` | **Tag:** v1.0.1 (failed build)
#### What changed
- apktool jar was being written to `/usr/local/lib/` which is read-only on GitHub runners
- Changed to `$HOME/bin/` for both the jar and wrapper script
- Switched from `apktool` wrapper to `java -jar apktool.jar` calls directly
#### Files touched
- `.github/workflows/build.yml`

---

### [fix] — Workflow: raws.xml aapt2 compile error
**Commit:** `fb55474` | **Tag:** v1.0.2 (failed build)
#### What changed
- `res/values/raws.xml` contains Firebase boolean entries (`firebase_common_keep`, `firebase_crashlytics_keep`) that aapt2 rejects — expects file references, not boolean values
- Added workflow step to `rm -f apktool_out/res/values/raws.xml` after decompile
#### Files touched
- `.github/workflows/build.yml`

---

### [fix] — Workflow: dangling public.xml firebase symbols
**Commit:** `415a2b1` | **Tag:** v1.0.3 ✅ **FIRST SUCCESSFUL BUILD**
#### What changed
- Deleting `raws.xml` left `public.xml` declaring those symbols → aapt2 "no definition for declared symbol" error
- Added `sed -i '/firebase_common_keep\|firebase_crashlytics_keep/d' apktool_out/res/values/public.xml` to workflow after the raws.xml deletion
- **Build succeeded** — `Gamehub-rebuilt.apk` produced and uploaded to v1.0.3 release
#### Files touched
- `.github/workflows/build.yml`

---

### [patch] — Rename "My" tab to "My Games"
**Commit:** `6433837` | **Tag:** v1.0.0 (preceded fix commits, rolled into v1.0.3 build)
#### What changed
- String key `llauncher_main_page_title_my` changed from `"My"` to `"My Games"`
- Affects the top toolbar tab label in the main launcher screen
#### Files touched
- `patches/res/values/strings.xml` (line 1410)

---

### [patch] — Add BCI launcher button to top bar
**Commit:** `b148ee2` | **Tag:** v1.0.4 (failed — firebase regression)
#### What changed
- Added a small "open in new" icon button (`iv_bci_launcher`) to the top-right toolbar, after the search icon
- Tapping it launches BannersComponentInjector (`com.banner.inject`) if installed
- If BCI is not installed, shows a Toast: "BannersComponentInjector is not installed"
- New smali class `BciLauncherClickListener` handles the click logic
- Button wired in `LandscapeLauncherMainActivity.initView()` via `findViewById` + `setOnClickListener`
- New resource ID `iv_bci_launcher` = `0x7f0a0ef9`
#### Files touched
- `patches/res/layout/llauncher_activity_new_launcher_main.xml` — added ImageView
- `patches/res/values/ids.xml` — added `iv_bci_launcher` entry
- `patches/res/values/public.xml` — added public ID `0x7f0a0ef9`
- `patches/smali_classes9/com/xj/landscape/launcher/R$id.smali` — added field
- `patches/smali_classes11/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/main/BciLauncherClickListener.smali` — new file
- `patches/smali_classes11/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/main/LandscapeLauncherMainActivity.smali` — initView hook

---

### [fix] — patches/public.xml reintroduced firebase symbols
**Commit:** `c30103f` | **Tag:** v1.0.5 (in progress)
#### What changed
- The `patches/res/values/public.xml` overlay was overwriting the workflow-cleaned version, putting firebase entries back
- Removed `firebase_common_keep` and `firebase_crashlytics_keep` lines from `patches/public.xml`
- **Rule going forward:** Any patch that includes `public.xml` or touches resource files must also not contain the two firebase raw entries
#### Files touched
- `patches/res/values/public.xml`

---

## Known Issues / Notes

- **firebase raws rule:** Never include `firebase_common_keep` or `firebase_crashlytics_keep` entries in any patched `public.xml` — they have no corresponding raw file and aapt2 will reject the build
- **Signing:** Debug key only (`keystore.jks`). Must uninstall existing GameHub before sideloading rebuilt APK (signature mismatch)
- **Base APK:** `Gamehub-5.3.5-Revanced-Normal.apk` stored in `base-apk` release — do not delete
- **apktool version:** 2.9.3 (pinned in workflow)
- **DataBinding note:** The main launcher uses DataBinding. New views added via layout XML patches can be wired via `getMDataBind().getRoot().findViewById()` in `initView` without touching the binding impl classes

## Planned Work

- [ ] Option B: Embed BCI component manager as a full in-app tab (requires Kotlin compile → smali merge pipeline)
- [ ] Explore contributing functional patches to `playday3008/gamehub-patches` PR #13
